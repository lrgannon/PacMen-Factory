**PACMEN FACTORY**

**Description**

The PacMen Factory game is played by clicking two buttons. The user can click the Add PacMan button to add an additional PacMan with each click. The PacMen appear on the screen placed in random positions. The animation portion will begin once the Start Game button is clicked. The PacMen on the screen will then begin moving around the screen in random directions and at varying speeds. The user can add PacMen both before and after the Start Game button has been clicked and the animation has started.

**How to Run**

Download all the files and make sure they are all stored within the same folder. The game will then run locally by opening the index.html file in a browser.

**Planned Future Improvements**

In the future, I plan to add a background as well as ghost images and fruit images to add more color and nostalgia.
